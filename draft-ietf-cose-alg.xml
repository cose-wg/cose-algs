      <section anchor="cbor-grammar" title="CBOR Grammar">

        <t>
          There currently is no standard CBOR grammar available for use by specifications.
          We therefore describe the CBOR structures in prose.
          There is a version of a CBOR grammar in the CBOR Data Definition Language (CDDL) <xref target="I-D.greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl"/>.
          An informational version of the CBOR grammar that reflects what is in the prose can be found in <xref target="Grammar_Appendix"/>.
          CDDL has not been fixed, so this grammar may will only work with the version of CDDL at the time of publishing.
        </t>

        <t>
          The document was developed by first working on the grammar and then developing the prose to go with it.
          An artifact of this is that the prose was written using the primitive type strings defined by early versions CDDL.
          In this specification the following primitive types are used:
          <list style="none">
            <t>bstr - byte string (major type 2).</t>
            <t>int - an unsigned integer or a negative integer.</t>
            <t>nil - a null value (tag 7.22).</t>
            <t>nint - a negative integer (major type 1).</t>
            <t>tstr - a UTF-8 text string (major type 3).</t>
            <t>uint - an unsigned integer (major type 0).</t>
          </list>

          NOTE: For the purposes of review, we are currently interlacing the CDLL grammar into the text of document.
          This is being done for simplicity of comparision of the grammar againist the prose.
          The grammar will be removed to an appendix during WGLC.

        This document defines one new signature algorithm: RSA-PSS.
        Both of these signature algorithms are Signature Scheme with Appendix algorithms.

          The RSASSA-PSS signature algorithm is defined in <xref target="RFC3447"/>.

        <t>
          The RSASSA-PSS signature algorithm is parametized with a hash function (h), a mask generation function (mgf) and a salt length (sLen).
          For this specification, the mask generation function is fixed to be MGF1 as defined in <xref target="RFC3447"/>.
          It has been recommended that the same hash function be used for hashing the data as well as in the mask generation function, for this specification we following this recommendation.
          The salt length is the same length as the hash function output.

          Implementations need to check that the key type is 'RSA' when creating or verifying a signature.

          <t>
            In addition to needing to worry about keys that are too small to provide the required security,  there are issues with keys that are too large.
            Denial of service attacks have been mounted with overly large keys.
            This has the potential to consume resources with potentially bad keys.
            There are two reasonable ways to address this attack.
            First, a key should not be used for a cryptographic operation until it has been matched back to an authorized user.
            This approach means that no cryptography would be done except for authorized users.
            Second, applications can impose maximum as well as minimum length requirements on keys.
            This limits the resources consumed even if the matching is not performed until the cryptography has been done.
          </t>

          <t>
            There is a theoretical hash substitution attack that can be mounted against RSASSA-PSS.
            However, the requirement that the same hash function be used consistently for all operations is an effective mitigation against it.
            Unlike ECDSA, hash functions are not truncated so that the full hash value is always signed.
            The internal padding structure of RSASSA-PSS means that one needs to have multiple collisions between the two hash functions in order to be successful in producing a forgery based on changing the hash function.
            This is highly unlikely.

          RSAES-OAEP is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm.
          The defintion of RSAEA-OAEP can be find in Section 7.1 of <xref target="RFC3447"/>.
          The algorithm is parameterized using a masking generation function (mgf), a hash function (h) and encoding parameters (P).

          <t>
            A key size of 2048 bits or larger MUST be used with these algorithms.
            This key size corresponds roughly to the same strength as provided by a 128-bit symmetric encryption algorithm.
          </t>

          <t>
            It is highly recommended that checks on the key length  be done before starting a decryption operation.
            One potential denial of service operation is to provide encrypted objects using either abnormally long or oddly sized RSA modulus values.
            Implementations SHOULD be able to encrypt and decrypt with modulus between 2048 and 16K bits in length.
            Applications can impose additional restrictions on the length of the modulus.

        The COSE_Key object defines a way to hold a single key object, it is still required that the members of individual key types be defined.
        This section of the document is where we define an initial set of members for specific key types.
      </t>

      <t>
        For each of the key types, we define both public and private members.
        The public members are what is transmitted to others for their usage.
        We define private members mainly for the purpose of archival of keys by individuals.
        However, there are some circumstances where private keys may be distributed by various entities in a protocol.
        Examples include:  Entities which have poor random number generation.
        Centralized key creation for multi-cast type operations.
        Protocols where a shared secret is used as a bearer token for authorization purposes.
      </t>

        Key types are identified by the 'kty' member of the COSE_Key object.

          For private keys, it is RECOMMENDED that 'x' also be present, but it can be recomputed from the required elements and omitting it saves on space.

      <section title="RSA Keys">
        <t>
          This document defines a key structure for both the public and private halves of RSA keys.
          Together, an RSA public key and an RSA private key form an RSA key pair.
          <cref source="JLS">
            Looking at the CBOR specification, the bstr that we are looking in our table below should most likely be specified as big numbers rather than as binary strings.
            This means that we would use the tag 6.2 instead.
            From my reading of the specification, there is no difference in the encoded size of the resulting output.
            The specification of bignum does explicitly allow for integers encoded with leading zeros.
          </cref>
        </t>

        <t>
          The document also provides support for the so-called "multi-prime" RSA where the modulus may have more than two prime factors.
          The benefit of multi-prime RSA is lower computational cost for the decryption and signature primitives.
          For a discussion on how multi-prime affects the security of RSA crypto-systems, the reader is referred to <xref target="MultiPrimeRSA"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          This document follows the naming convention of <xref target="RFC3447"/> for the naming of the fields of an RSA public or private key.
          The table <xref target="table-rsa-keys"/> provides a summary of the label values and the types associated with each of those labels.
          The requirements for fields for RSA keys are as follows:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              For all keys, 'kty' MUST be present and MUST have a value of 3.
            </t>
            <t>
              For public keys, the fields 'n' and 'e' MUST be present. 
              All other fields defined in <xref target="table-rsa-keys"/> MUST be absent.
            </t>
            <t>
              For private keys with two primes, the fields 'other', 'r_i', 'd_i' and 't_i' MUST be absent, all other fields MUST be present.
            </t>
            <t>
              For private keys with more than two primes, all fields MUST  be present. 
              For the third to nth primes, each of the primes is represented as a map containing the fields 'r_i', 'd_i' and 't_i'. 
              The field 'other' is an array of those maps.
            </t>
