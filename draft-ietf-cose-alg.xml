        <t>
          There currently is no standard CBOR grammar available for use by specifications.
          We therefore describe the CBOR structures in prose.
          There is a version of a CBOR grammar in the CBOR Data Definition Language (CDDL) <xref target="I-D.greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl"/>.
          An informational version of the CBOR grammar that reflects what is in the prose can be found in <xref target="Grammar_Appendix"/>.
          CDDL has not been fixed, so this grammar may will only work with the version of CDDL at the time of publishing.
        </t>

        <t>
          The document was developed by first working on the grammar and then developing the prose to go with it.
          An artifact of this is that the prose was written using the primitive type strings defined by early versions CDDL.
          In this specification the following primitive types are used:
          <list style="none">
            <t>bstr - byte string (major type 2).</t>
            <t>int - an unsigned integer or a negative integer.</t>
            <t>nil - a null value (tag 7.22).</t>
            <t>nint - a negative integer (major type 1).</t>
            <t>tstr - a UTF-8 text string (major type 3).</t>
            <t>uint - an unsigned integer (major type 0).</t>

          In JSON, maps are called objects and only have one kind of map key: a string.
          In COSE, we use both strings and integers (both negative and non-negative integers) as map keys, as well as data items to identify specific choices.
          The integers (both positive and negative) are used for compactness of encoding and easy comparison.
          (Generally, in this document the value zero is going to be reserved and not used.)
          Since the work "key" is mainly used in its other meaning, as a cryptographic key, we use the term "label" for this usage of either an integer or a string to identify map keys and choose data items.

      <section title="Document Terminology">
        <t>
          In this document we use the following terminology:
          <cref source="JLS">
            I have not gone through the document to determine what needs to be here yet.

    <section title="Signature Algorithms">
      <t>
        There are two basic signature algorithm structures that can be used.
        The first is the common signature with appendix.
        In this structure, the message content is processed and a signature is produced, the signature is called the appendix.
        This is the message structure used by our common algorithms such as ECDSA and RSASSA-PSS.
        (In fact the SSA in RSASSA-PSS stands for Signature Scheme with Appendix.)
        The basic structure becomes:
      </t>
      <figure><artwork>
        <![CDATA[
signature = Sign(message content, key)

valid = Verification(message content, key, signature)
]]>
      </artwork></figure>
      
      <t>
        The second is a signature with message recovery.
        (An example of such an algorithm is <xref target="PVSig"/>.)
        In this structure, the message content is processed, but part of is included in the signature.
        Moving bytes of the message content into the signature allows for an effectively smaller signature, the signature size is still potentially large, but the message content is shrunk.
        This has implications for systems implementing these algoritms and for applications that use them.
        The first is that the message content is not fully available until after a signature has been validated.
        Until that point the part of the message contained inside of the signature is unrecoverable.
        The second is that the security analysis of the strength of the signature is very much based on the structure of the message content.
        Messages which are highly predictable require additional randomness to be supplied as part of the signature process, in the worst case it becomes the same as doing a signature with appendix.
        Thirdly, in the event that multple signatures are applied to a message, all of the signature algorithms are going to be required to consume the same number of bytes of message content.
      </t>

      <figure><artwork>
        <![CDATA[
signature, message sent = Sign(message content, key)

valid, message content = Verification(message sent, key, signature)
]]>
      </artwork></figure>

      <t>
        At this time, only signatures with appendixes are defined for use with COSE, however considerable interest has been expressed in using a signature with message recovery algorithm due to the effective size reduction that is possible.
        Implementations will need to keep this in mind for later possible integration.
      </t>
      
      <section title="ECDSA">
        <t>
          ECDSA <xref target="DSS"/> defines a signature algorithm using ECC.
        </t>

        <t>
          The ECDSA signature algorithm is parameterized with a hash function (h).
          In the event that the length of the hash function output is greater than group of the key, the left most bytes of the hash output are used.
        </t>

        <t>
          The algorithms defined in this document can be found in <xref target="table_ecdsa"/>.
        </t>
        
        <texttable title="ECDSA Algorithm Values" anchor="table_ecdsa">
          <ttcol align='left'>name</ttcol>
          <ttcol align='left'>value</ttcol>
          <ttcol align='left'>hash</ttcol>
          <ttcol align='left'>description</ttcol>
          <c>ES256</c>        <c>-7</c>       <c>SHA-256</c>   <c>ECDSA w/ SHA-256</c>
          <c>ES384</c>        <c>-8</c>       <c>SHA-384</c>   <c>ECDSA w/ SHA-384</c>
          <c>ES512</c>        <c>-9</c>       <c>SHA-512</c>   <c>ECDSA w/ SHA-512</c>
        </texttable>

        <t>
          This document defines ECDSA to work only with the curves P-256, P-384 and P-521.
          This document requires that the curves be encoded using the 'EC2' key type.
          Implementations need to check that the key type and curve are correct when creating and verifying a signature.
          Other documents can defined it to work with other curves and points in the future.
        </t>

        <t>
          In order to promote interoperability, it is suggested that SHA-256 be used only with curve P-256, SHA-384 be used only with curve P-384 and SHA-512 be used with curve P-521.
          This is aligned with the recommendation in Section 4 of <xref target="RFC5480"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          The signature algorithm results in a pair of integers (R, S).
          These integers will be of the same order as length of the key used for the signature process.
          The signature is encoded by converting the integers into byte strings of the same length as the key size.
          The length is rounded up to the nearest byte and is left padded with zero bits to get to the correct length.
          The two integers are then concatenated together to form a byte string that is the resulting signature.
        </t>

        <t>
          Using the function defined in <xref target="RFC3447"/> the signature is:
          <vspace/>
          Signature = I2OSP(R, n) | I2OSP(S, n)
          <vspace/>
          where n = ceiling(key_length / 8)
        </t>

        <section title="Security Considerations">
          <t>
          The security strength of the signature is no greater than the minimum of the security strength associated with the bit length of the key and the security strength of the hash function.
        </t>

        <t>
          System which have poor random number generation can leak their keys by signing two different messages with the same value of 'k'.
          <xref target="RFC6979"/> provides a method to deal with this problem by making 'k' be deterministic based on the message content rather than randomly generated.
          Applications which specify ECDSA should evaluate the ability to get good random number generation and require this when it is not possible.
          Note: Use of this technique a good idea even when good random number generation exists.
          Doing so both reduces the possiblity of having the same value of 'k' in two signature operations, but allows for reproducable signature values which helps testing.
        </t>

        <t>
          There are two substitution that can theoretically be mounted against the ECDSA signature algorithm.
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              Changing the curve used to validate the signature:
              If one changes the curve used to validate the signature, then potentially one could have a two messages with the same signature each computed under a different curve.
              The only requirement on the new curve is that it's order be the same as the old one and it be acceptable to the client.
              An example would be to change from using the curve secp256r1 (aka P-256) to using secp256k1.
              (Both are 256 bit curves.)
              We current do not have any way to deal with this version of the attack except to restrict the overall set of curves that can be used.
            </t>

            <t>
              Change the hash function used to validate the signature:
              If one has either two different hash functions of the same length, or one can truncate a hash function down, then one could potentially find collisions between the hash functions rather than within a single hash function.
              (For example, truncating SHA-512 to 256 bits might collide with a SHA-256 bit hash value.)
              This attack can be mitigated by including the signature algorithm identifier in the data to be signed.

      <section title="RSASSA-PSS">
        <t>
          The RSASSA-PSS signature algorithm is defined in <xref target="RFC3447"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          The RSASSA-PSS signature algorithm is parametized with a hash function (h), a mask generation function (mgf) and a salt length (sLen).
          For this specification, the mask generation function is fixed to be MGF1 as defined in <xref target="RFC3447"/>.
          It has been recommended that the same hash function be used for hashing the data as well as in the mask generation function, for this specification we following this recommendation.
          The salt length is the same length as the hash function output.

          <t>
            In addition to needing to worry about keys that are too small to provide the required security,  there are issues with keys that are too large.
            Denial of service attacks have been mounted with overly large keys.
            This has the potential to consume resources with potentially bad keys.
            There are two reasonable ways to address this attack.
            First, a key should not be used for a cryptographic operation until it has been matched back to an authorized user.
            This approach means that no cryptography would be done except for authorized users.
            Second, applications can impose maximum as well as minimum length requirements on keys.
            This limits the resources consumed even if the matching is not performed until the cryptography has been done.
          </t>

          <t>
            There is a theoretical hash substitution attack that can be mounted against RSASSA-PSS.
            However, the requirement that the same hash function be used consistently for all operations is an effective mitigation against it.
            Unlike ECDSA, hash functions are not truncated so that the full hash value is always signed.
            The internal padding structure of RSASSA-PSS means that one needs to have multiple collisions between the two hash functions in order to be successful in producing a forgery based on changing the hash function.
            This is highly unlikely.

    <section title="Message Authentication (MAC) Algorithms">
      <t>
        Message Authentication Codes (MACs) provide data authentication and integrity protection.
        They provide either no or very limited data origination.
        (One cannot, for example, be used to prove the identity of the sender to a third party.)
      </t>

      <t>
        MACs are designed in the same basic structure as signature with appendix algorithms.
        The message content is processed and an authentication code is produced, the authentication code is frequently called a tag.
        The basic structure becomes:

        MAC algorithms can be based on either a block cipher algorithm (i.e. AES-MAC) or a hash algorithm (i.e. HMAC).

          The Hash-base Message Authentication Code algorithm (HMAC) <xref target="RFC2104"/><xref target="RFC4231"/> was designed to deal with length extension attacks.
          The algorithm was also designed to allow for new hash algorithms to be directly plugged in without changes to the hash function.
          The HMAC design process has been vindicated as, while the security of hash algorithms such as MD5 has decreased over time, the security of HMAC combined with MD5 has not yet been shown to be compromised <xref target="RFC6151"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          The HMAC algorithm is parameterized by an inner and outer padding, a hash function (h) and an authentication tag value length.
          For this specification, the inner and outer padding are fixed to the values set in <xref target="RFC2104"/>.
          The length of the authentication tag corresponds to the difficulty of producing a forgery.
          For use in constrained environments, we define a set of HMAC algorithms that are truncated.
          There are currently no known issues when truncating, however the security strength of the message tag is correspondingly reduced in strength.
          When truncating, the left most tag length bits are kept and transmitted.
        </t>

          The algorithm defined in this document can be found in <xref target="table-hmac"/>.

          Some recipient algorithms carry the key while others derive a key from secret data.
          For those algorithms which carry the key (i.e. RSA-OAEP and AES-KeyWrap), the size of the HMAC key SHOULD be the same size as the underlying hash function.
          For those algorithms which derive the key, the derived key MUST be the same size as the underlying hash function.

            HMAC has proved to be resistant even when used with weakening hash algorithms.
            The current best method appears to be a brute force attack on the key.
            This means that key size is going to be directly related to the security of an HMAC operation.

    <section title="Content Encryption Algorithms">
      <t>
        Content Encryption Algorithms provide data confidentialty for potentially large blocks of data using a symmetric key.
        They provide either no or very limited data origination.
        (One cannot, for example, be used to prove the identity of the sender to a third party.)
        The ability to provide data origination is linked to how the symmetric key is obtained.
      </t>

      <t>
        We restrict the set of legal content encryption algorithms to those which support authentication both of the content and additional data.
        The encryption process will generate some type of authentication value, but that value may be either explicit or implicit in terms of the algorithm definition.
        For simplicity sake, the authentication code will normally be defined as being appended to the cipher text stream.
        The basic structure becomes:

        <![CDATA[
ciphertext = Encrypt(message content, key, additional data)

valid, message content = Decrypt(cipher text, key, additional data)

      </artwork></figure>

      <t>
        Most AEAD algorithms are logically defined as returning the message content only if the decryption is valid.
        Many but not all implementations will follow this convention.
        The message content MUST NOT be used if the decryption does not validate.

      <section title="AES CCM">
        <t>
          Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) is a generic authentication encryption block cipher mode defined in <xref target="RFC3610"/>.
          The CCM mode is combined with the AES block encryption algorithm to define a commonly used content encryption algorithm used in constrainted devices.
        </t>

        <t>
          The CCM mode has two parameter choices.
          The first choice is M, the size of the authentication field.
          The choice of the value for M involves a trade-off between message expansion and the probably that an attacker can undetecably modify a message.
          
          The second choice is L, the size of the length field.
          This value requires a trade-off between the maximum message size and the size of the Nonce.
        </t>

        <t>
          It is unfortunate that the specification for CCM specified L and M as a count of bytes rather than a count of bits.
          This leads to possible misunderstandings where AES-CCM-8 is frequently used to refer to a version of CCM mode where the size of the authentication is 64-bits and not 8-bits.
          These values have traditionally been specified as bit counts rather than byte counts.
          This document will follow the tradition of using bit counts so that it is easier to compare the different algorithms presented in this document.
        </t>

        <t>
          We define a matrix of algorithms in this document over the values of L and M.
          Constrained devices are usually operating in situations where they use short messages and want to avoid doing recipient specific cryptographic operations.
          This favors smaller values of M and larger values of L.
          Less constrained devices do will want to be able to user larger messages and are more willing to generate new keys for every operation.
          This favors larger values of M and smaller values of L.
          (The use of a large nonce means that random generation of both the key and the nonce will decrease the chances of repeating the pair on two different messages.)
        </t>

        <t>
          The following values are used for L:
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="16-bits (2)">
              limits messages to 2^16 bytes (64Kbyte) in length.
              This sufficently long for messages in the constrainted world.
              The nonce length is 13 bytes allowing for 2^(13*8) possible values of the nonce without repeating.
            </t>
            <t hangText="64-bits (8)"> 
              limits messages to 2^64 byes in length.
              The nonce length is 7 bytes allowing for 2^56 possible values of the nonce without repeating.
            </t>

            It is possible to do a pre-computation attack against the algorithm in cases where the portions encryption content is highly predictable.
            This reduces the security of the key size by half.
            Ways to deal with this attack include adding a random portion to the nonce value and/or increasing the key size used.
            Using a portion of the nonce for a random value will decrease the number of messages that a single key can be used for.
            Increasing the key size may require more resources in the constrained device.

          <t>Secrets which are uniformly random:  This is the type of secret which is created by a good random number generator.</t>
          <t>Secrets which are not uniformly random: This is type of secret which is created by operations like key agreement.</t>
          <t>Secrets which are not random: This is the type of secret that people generate for things like passwords.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        General KDF functions work well with the first type of secret, can do reasonable well with the second type of secret and generally do poorly with the last type of secret.
        None of the KDF functions in this section are designed to deal with the type of secrets that are used for passwords.
        Functions like PBSE2 <xref target="RFC2898"/> need to be used for that type of secret.
      </t>

      <t>
        Many functions are going to handle the first two type of secrets differently.
        The KDF function defined in <xref target="HKDF"/> can use different underlying constructions if the secret is uniformly random than if the secret is not uniformly random.
        This is reflected in the set of algorithms defined for HKDF.
      </t>

      <t>
        When using KDF functions, one component that is generally included is context information.
        Context information is used to allow for different keying information to be derived from the same secret.
        The use of context based keying material is considered to be a good security practice.
        This document defines a single context structure and a single KDF function.
      </t>
      
      <section title="HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF)" anchor="HKDF">
        <t> 
          The HKDF key derivation algorithm is defined in <xref target="RFC5869"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          The HKDF algorithm is defined to take a number of inputs
          These inputs are:

          <list style="none">
            <t>
              secret - a shared value that is secret.
              Secrets may be either previously shared or derived from operations like a DH key agreement.
            </t>

            <t>
              salt - an optional public value that is used to change the generation process.
              If specified, the salt is carried using the 'salt' algorithm parameter.
              While <xref target="RFC5869"/> suggests that the length of the salt be the same as the length of the underlying hash value, any amount of salt will improve the security as different key values will be generated.
              A parameter to carry the salt is defined in <xref target="HKDF_Alg_Params"/>.
              This parameter is protected by being included in the key computation and does not need to be separately authenticated.
            </t>

            <t>
              length - the number of bytes of output that need to be generated.
            </t>

            <t>
              context information - Information that describes the context in which the resulting value will be used.
              Making this information specific to the context that the material is going to be used ensures that the resulting material will always be unique.
              The context structure used is encoded into the algorithm identifier.
            </t>

            <t>
              hash function - The underlying hash function to be used in the HKDF algorithm.
              The hash function is encoded into the HKDF algorithm selection.
            </t>

          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          HKDF is defined to use HMAC as the underlying PRF.
          However, it is possible to use other functions in the same construct to provide a different KDF function that may be more appropriate in the constrained world.
          Specifically, one can use AES-CBC-MAC as the PRF for the expand step, but not for the extract step.
          When using a good random shared secret of the correct length, the extract step can be skipped.
          The extract cannot be skipped if the secret is not uniformly random, for example if it is the result of a ECDH key agreement step.

      <section title="Context Information Structure" anchor="context">
        <t>
          The context information structure is used to ensure that the derived keying material is "bound" to the context of the transaction.
          The context information structure used here is based on that defined in <xref target="SP800-56A"/>.
          By using CBOR for the encoding of the context information structure, we automatically get the same type of type and length separation of fields that is obtained by the use of ASN.1.
          This means that there is no need to encode the lengths for the base elements as it is done by the JOSE encoding.
          <cref source="Ilari">
            Look to see if we need to be clearer about how the fields defined in the table are transported and thus why they have labels.
          </cref>
        </t>

        <t>
          The context information structure refers to PartyU and PartyV as the two parties which are doing the key derivation.
          Unless the application protocol defines differently, we assign PartyU to the entity that is creating the message and PartyV to the entity that is receiving the message.
          By doing this association, different keys will be derived for each direction as the context information is different in each direction.
        </t>

        <t>
          Application protocols are free to define the roles differently.
          For example, they could assign the PartyU role to the entity that initiates the connection and allow directly sending multiple messages over the connection in both directions without changing the role information.
        </t>

        <t>
          The use of a transaction identifier, either in one of the supplemental fields or as the salt if one is using HKDF, ensures that a unique key is generated for each set of transactions.
          Combining nonce fields with the transaction identifier provides a method so that a different key is used for each message in each direction.
        </t>

        <t>
          The context structure is built from information that is known to both entities.
          Some of the information is known only to the two entities, some is implied based on the application and some is explicitly transported as part of the message.
          The information that can be carried in the message, parameters have been defined and can be found in <xref target="KDF_Context_Alg_Params"/>.
          These parameters are designed to be placed in the unprotected bucket of the recipient structure.
          (They do not need to be in the protected bucket since they already are included in the cryptographic computation by virtue of being included in the context structure.)
        </t>

        <t>
          We encode the context specific information using a CBOR array type.
          The fields in the array are:

          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="AlgorithmID">
              This field indicates the algorithm for which the key material will be used.
              This field is required to be present and is a copy of the algorithm identifier in the message.
              The field exists in the context information so that if the same environment is used for different algorithms, then completely different keys will be generated each of those algorithms.
              (This practice means if algorithm A is broken and  thus can is easier to find, the key derived for algorithm B will not be the same as the key for algorithm B.)
            </t>

            <t hangText="PartyUInfo">
              This field holds information about party U.
              The PartyUInfo is encoded as a CBOR struture.
              The elements of PartyUInfo are encoded in the order presented, however if the element does not exist no element is placed in the array.
              The elements of the PartyUInfo array are:
              
              <list style="hanging">
                <t hangText="identity">
                  This contains the identity information for party U.
                  The identities can be assigned in one of two manners.
                  Firstly, a protocol can assign identities based on roles.
                  For example, the roles of "client" and "server" may be assigned to different entities in the protocol.
                  Each entity would then use the correct label for the data they they send or receive.
                  The second way is for a protocol to assign identities is to use a name based on a naming system (i.e. DNS, X.509 names).
                  <vspace/>
                  We define an algorithm parameter 'PartyU identity' that can be used to carry identity information in the message.
                  However, identity information is often known as part of the protocol and can thus be inferred rather than made explicit.
                  If identity information is carried in the message, applications SHOULD have a way of validating the supplied identity information.
                  The identity information does not need to be specified and can be left as absent.
                  <vspace/>
                  The identity value supplied will be integrity checked as part of the key derivation process.
                  If the identity string is wrong, then the wrong key will be created.
                </t>

                <t hangText="nonce">
                  This contains a one time nonce value.
                  The nonce can either be implicit from the protocol or carried as a value in the unprotected headers.
                  <vspace/>
                  We define an algorithm parameter 'PartyU nonce' that can be used to carry this value in the message
                  However, the nonce value could be determined by the application and the value determined from elsewhere.
                  <vspace/>

        COSE has the ability to support many classes of recipient algorithms.

            <section title="Security Considerations">
              <t>
                This recipient algorithm has several potential problems that need to be considered:
                <list style="symbols">
                  <t>
                    These keys need to have some method to be regularly updated over time.
                    All of the content encryption algorithms specified in this document have limits on how many times a key can be used without significant loss of security.
                  </t>
                  <t>
                    These keys need to be dedicated to a single algorithm.
                    There have been a number of attacks developed over time when a single key is used for multiple different algorithms.
                    One example of this is the use of a single key both for CBC encryption mode and CBC-MAC authentication mode.
                  </t>
                  <t>
                    Breaking one message means all messages are broken.
                    If an adversary succeeds in determining the key for a single message, then the key for all messages is also determined.
                  </t>

          <section title="Direct Key with KDF">
            <t>
              These recipient algorithms take a common shared secret between the two parties and applies the HKDF function (<xref target="HKDF"/>) using the context structure defined in <xref target="context"/> to transform the shared secret into the necessary key.
              Either the 'salt' parameter of HKDF or the partyU 'nonce' parameter of the context structure MUST be present.
              This parameter can be generated either randomly or deterministically, the requirement is that it be a unique value for the key pair in question.
            </t>

            <t>
              If the salt/nonce value is generated randomly, then it is suggested that the length of the random value be the same length as the hash function underlying HKDF.
              While there is no way to guarantee that it will be unique, there is a high probability that it will be unique.
              If the salt/nonce value is generated deterministically, it can be guaranteed to be unique and thus there is no length requirement.
            </t>

            <t>
              A new IV must be used if the same key is used in more than one message.
              The IV can be modified in a predictable manner, a random manner or an unpredictable manner.
              One unpredictable manner that can be used is to use the HKDF function to generate the IV.
              If HKDF is used for generating the IV, the algorithm identifier is set to "IV-GENERATION".

          In key wrapping mode, the CEK is randomly generated and that key is then encrypted by a shared secret between the sender and the recipient.
          All of the currently defined key wrapping algorithms for JOSE (and thus for COSE) are AE algorithms.
          Key wrapping mode is considered to be superior to direct encryption if the system has any capability for doing random key generation.
          This is because the shared key is used to wrap random data rather than data  has some degree of organization and may in fact be repeating the same content.

      <section title="Direct Key Agreement">
        <t>
          The 'direct key agreement' class of recipient algorithms uses a key agreement method to create a shared secret.
          A KDF is then applied to the shared secret to derive a key to be used in protecting the data.
          This key is normally used as a CEK or MAC key, but could be used for other purposes if more than two layers are in use (see <xref target="three-layer"/>).
        </t>

        <t>
          The most commonly used key agreement algorithm used is Diffie-Hellman, but other variants exist.
          Since COSE is designed for a store and forward environment rather than an on-line environment, many of the DH variants cannot be used as the receiver of the message cannot provide any key material.
          One side-effect of this is that perfect forward security is not achievable, a static key will always be used for the receiver of the COSE message.
        </t>

        <t>
          Two variants of DH that are easily supported are:
          <list>
            <t>
-              Ephemeral-Static DH: where the sender of the message creates a one time DH key and uses a static key for the recipient.
              The use of the ephemeral sender key means that no additional random input is needed as this is randomly generated for each message.
            </t>

            <t>
              Static-Static DH: where a static key is used for both the sender and the recipient.
              The use of static keys allows for recipient to get a weak version of data origination for the message.
              When static-static key agreement is used, then some piece of unique data is require to ensure that a different key is created for each message
            </t>
          </list>
          
          In this specification, both variants are specified.
          This has been done to provide the weak data origination option for use with MAC operations.
        </t>

        <t>
          When direct key agreement mode is used, there MUST be only one recipient in the message.
          This method creates the key directly and that makes it difficult to mix with additional recipients.
          If multiple recipients are needed, then the version with key wrap needs to be used.

                Ephemeral-static or static-static:
                The key agreement process may be done using either a static or an ephemeral key at the senders side.
                When using ephemeral keys, the sender MUST generate a new ephemeral key for every key agreement operation.
                The ephemeral key is placed in in the 'ephemeral key' parameter and MUST be present for all algorithm identifiers which use ephemeral keys.
                When using static keys, the sender MUST either generate a new random value placed in either in the KDF parameters or the context structure.
                For the KDF functions used, this means either in the 'salt' parameter for HKDF (<xref target="HKDF_Alg_Params"/>) or in in the 'PartyU nonce' parameter for the context struture (<xref target="KDF_Context_Alg_Params"/>) MUST be present.
                (Both may be present if desired.)
                The value in the parameter MUST be unique for the key pair being used.
                It is acceptable to use a global counter which is incremented for every static-static operation and use the resulting value.
                When using static keys, the static key needs to be identified to the recipient.
                The static key can be identified either by providing the key ('static key') or by providing a key identifier for the static key ('static key id').

                The result of an ECDH key agreement process does not provide a uniformly random secret, as such it needs to be run through a KDF in order to produce a usable key.
                Processing the secret through a KDF also allows for the introduction of both context material, how the key is going to be used, and one time material in the even to of a static-static key agreement.

              <t>
                Key Wrap algorithm:
                The key wrap algorithm can be 'none' if the result of the KDF is going to be used as the key directly.
                This option, along with static-static, should be used if knowledge about the sender is desired.
                If 'none' is used then the content layer encryption algorithm size is value fed to the context structure.
                Support is also provided for any of the key wrap algorithms defined in section <xref target="key_wrap_algs"/>.

        The COSE_Key object defines a way to hold a single key object, it is still required that the members of individual key types be defined.
        This section of the document is where we define an initial set of members for specific key types.
      </t>

      <t>
        For each of the key types, we define both public and private members.
        The public members are what is transmitted to others for their usage.
        We define private members mainly for the purpose of archival of keys by individuals.
        However, there are some circumstances where private keys may be distributed by various entities in a protocol.
        Examples include:  Entities which have poor random number generation.
        Centralized key creation for multi-cast type operations.
        Protocols where a shared secret is used as a bearer token for authorization purposes.
      </t>

      <t>
        Key types are identified by the 'kty' member of the COSE_Key object.
        In this document we define four values for the member.

            The traditional way of sending EC curves has been to send either both the x and y coordinates, or the x coordinate and a sign bit for the y coordinate.
            The latter encoding has not been recommend in the IETF due to potential IPR issues with Certicom.
            However, for operations in constrained environments, the ability to shrink a message by not sending the y coordinate is potentially useful.

          This document defines a key structure for both the public and private halves of RSA keys.
          Together, an RSA public key and an RSA private key form an RSA key pair.
          <cref source="JLS">
            Looking at the CBOR specification, the bstr that we are looking in our table below should most likely be specified as big numbers rather than as binary strings.
            This means that we would use the tag 6.2 instead.
            From my reading of the specification, there is no difference in the encoded size of the resulting output.
            The specification of bignum does explicitly allow for integers encoded with leading zeros.

          The document also provides support for the so-called "multi-prime" RSA where the modulus may have more than two prime factors.
          The benefit of multi-prime RSA is lower computational cost for the decryption and signature primitives.
          For a discussion on how multi-prime affects the security of RSA crypto-systems, the reader is referred to <xref target="MultiPrimeRSA"/>.

        <t>
          This document follows the naming convention of <xref target="RFC3447"/> for the naming of the fields of an RSA public or private key.
          The table <xref target="table-rsa-keys"/> provides a summary of the label values and the types associated with each of those labels.
          The requirements for fields for RSA keys are as follows:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              For all keys, 'kty' MUST be present and MUST have a value of 3.

            <t>
              For public keys, the fields 'n' and 'e' MUST be present. 
              All other fields defined in <xref target="table-rsa-keys"/> MUST be absent.
            </t>
            <t>
              For private keys with two primes, the fields 'other', 'r_i', 'd_i' and 't_i' MUST be absent, all other fields MUST be present.
            </t>
            <t>
              For private keys with more than two primes, all fields MUST  be present. 
              For the third to nth primes, each of the primes is represented as a map containing the fields 'r_i', 'd_i' and 't_i'. 
              The field 'other' is an array of those maps.

          For symmetric keys, the 'kty' member is set to 3 (Symmetric).

        There as been an attempt to limit the number of places where the document 
        needs to impose restrictions on how the CBOR Encoder needs to work.  We have
        managed to narrow it down to the following restrictions:
      </t>

      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            The restriction applies to the encoding the Sig_structure, the Enc_structure, and the MAC_structure.
          </t>
          <t>
            The rules for Canonical CBOR (Section 3.9 of RFC 7049) MUST be used in these
            locations.  The main rule that needs to be enforced is that all lengths
            in these structures MUST be encoded such that they are encoded using definite lengths 
            and the minimum length encoding is used.
          </t>
          <t>
            All parsers used SHOULD fail on both parsing and generation if the same label is used twice as a key for the same map.

    <section anchor="Grammar_Appendix" title="CDDL Grammar">

      <t>
        For people who prefer using a formal language to describe the syntax of the CBOR, in this section a CDDL grammar is given that corresponds to <xref target="I-D.greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl"/>.
        This grammar is informational, in the event of differences between this grammar and the prose, the prose is considered to be authorative.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        The collected CDDL can be extracted from the XML version of this document via the following XPath expression below.
        (Depending on the XPath evaluator one is using, it may be necessary to deal with &amp;gt; as an entity.)
      </t>

    </section>
    
    <section anchor="examples" title="Examples">

      <t>
        The examples can be found at https://github.com/cose-wg/Examples.  The file names in each section correspond the the same file names in the repository. I am currently still in the process of getting the examples up there along with some control information for people to be able to check and reproduce the examples.
      </t>

      <t>
        Examples may have some features that are in questions but not yet incorporated in the document.
      </t>

      <t>
        To make it easier to read, the examples are presented using the CBOR's diagnostic notation rather than a binary dump.
        A ruby based tool exists to convert between a number of formats.
        This tool can be installed with the command line:
      </t>
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[gem install cbor-diag]]>
        </artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>
        The diagnostic notation can be converted into binary files using the following command line:
      </t>
      <figure><artwork>
<![CDATA[          
         diag2cbor < inputfile > outputfile
         ]]>
      </artwork></figure>

      <t>
        The examples can be extracted from the XML version of this docuent via an XPath expression as all of the artwork is tagged with the attribute  type='CBORdiag'.
